# Roadmap To Anything #

## Teach and learn things in the right order ##

## Summary ##
  > If someone asked you to teach them some skill, or if you wanted to share a new music artist with a friend, showing them one article or one song isn't going to cut it. It often takes a step-by-step process to truly learn or appreciate new things. With Roadmap To Anything you create simple step-by-step paths to help others learn about any topic -- from bands to programming to birdwatching -- or earn points and badges for following a roadmap to learn something new yourself.

## Problem ##
  > This web application solves the problem of sharing complex skills and tastes. Just sending someone a link doesn't do the topic justice.

## Solution ##
  > Roadmap to Anything makes it easy to craft simple step-by-step guides to help people fully appreciate the thing you are trying to share with them.

## Quote from Us ##
  > "This application is essentially making the resource curation process simple, shareable, and fun."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Sign up in seconds and run a search on anything thing you want to learn more about. Pick the Roadmap that's right for you, and follow its trail of links. As you complete each step, you'll gain points and earn badges, and of course, you'll be closer to your new goal.

  > Then when you want to share the right way to learn something you know, pull together a special order of links to make a roadmap of your own and share it with the world. 

## Example Customer Quote ##
  > "My mom's an expert in impressionist art, and it's always been around, but I never really appreciated it. I had him make a roadmap for me, and now I don't just appreciate the art now, but I've connected with my mom."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Exerybody wants to learn something, and the answers are probably on the Internet, but why explore in the dark by yourself? Let experts around the world show you what to look up, and in what order.
