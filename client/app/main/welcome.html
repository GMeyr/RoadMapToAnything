       <div class="divider"></div>
       <p>A Roadmap is an ordered collection of links with a brief description at each step. People from all over the world make them to help others lean a new skill or appeciation. They're easy to make, easy to search for, and make your learning process so much more effective than just surfing blog posts.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>If someone asked you to teach them some skill, or if you wanted to share a new music artist with a friend, showing them one article or one song isn't going to cut it. It often takes a step-by-step process to truly learn or appreciate new things. With <i>Roadmap To Anything</i>, you create simple step-by-step paths to help others learn about any topic -- from bands to programming to birdwatching -- or earn points and badges for following a roadmap to learn something new yourself!</p>
