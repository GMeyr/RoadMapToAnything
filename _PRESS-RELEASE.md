There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Roadmap To Anything

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Show others the steps to learning something you love.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  If someone asked you to teach them some skill, or if you wanted to share a new music artist with a friend, showing them one article or one song isn't going to cut it. It often takes a step-by-step process to truly learn or appreciate new things. With Roadmap To Anything you create simple step-by-step paths to help others learn about any topic -- from bands to programming to birdwatching -- or earn points and badges for following a roadmap to learn something new yourself.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  This web application solves the problem of sharing complex skills and tastes. Just sending someone a link doesn't do the topic justice.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Roadmap to Anything makes it easy to craft simple step-by-step guides to help people fully appreciate the thing you are trying to share with them.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "This application is essentially making the resource curation process simple, shareable, and fun."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Sign up in seconds and run a search on anything thing you want to learn more about. Pick the Roadmap that's right for you, and follow its trail of links. Then when you want to share the right way to learn something you know, pull together links to make a roadmap of your own and share it with the world. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "My mom's an expert in impressionist art, and it's always been around, but I never really appreciated it. I had him make a roadmap for me, and now I don't just appreciate the art now, but I've connected with my mom."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  "Exerybody wants to learn something, and the answers are probably on the Internet, but why explore in the dark by yourself? Let experts around the world show you what to look up, and in what order. Everyone knows something special also, so help others that too with something as simple as a collection of links. Sign up today and grab a map!"
